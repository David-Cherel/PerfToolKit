RWP Network Latency/Throughput:
The dbrwplt tool measures the network latency between client and an Oracle database. Moreover, dbrwplt measures and demonstrates the impact of network latency on application throughput between client and Oracle database. Basically, dbrwplt allows to understand better where is time spent outside the database the network or the application code.
Use cases for the tool are:
    Assessing the impact of network changes for instance moving from on premise setup to the a mixed setup on-premise app servers and the database in the cloud
    Trouble shooting application performance top to bottom 
    Measure ping (dpiConn_ping) time
